## Solving OOP Problems
### RB120

- Breakdown the problem description
- List all nouns and code out the relevant classes with relationships
- Assign behaviors to each class, copy+paste comments into each class
- Make code DRY by extracting methods to modules
- Code out the methods
- Code out the implementation of each method, doing PEDAC if necessary 
on more complicated ones
- Check that each method has one responsibility and is not outputting 
and returning a meaningful value, if so, extract to helper methods
- Test as you go along by invoking public methods outside the class
- Once implementation works, apply method access control
