P: Understand the Problem

1. **Assess available information and state what you *know* about problem.**
-
-
-

2. **Restate explicit requirements:**
- Inputs:
- Outputs:
-
-
-
3. **If possible or necessary, type out a visual representation of the data structure:**

E: Examples/test cases

1. **What are your assumptions about problem, are they valid?:**
-
-
-

2. **Clarifying questions:**
- Problem domain:
-
-
3. **Identify implicit requirements:**
-
-
-
4. **Create a mental model of the problem based on everything you have learned up until here:**

D: Data Structures

1. **What data structure is best suited to convert the input into the intended output:**
-

A: Algorithm

*keep it high-level, avoid implementation level talk - that comes next.*

1. **The logical set of steps for how to get from A (input) to B (output) - keep in mind the data structure:**
-
-
-
-
-

C: Code

*Using a programming language, translate the algorithm into code*

1. **Code:**
```

```

2. **Test cases:**
